NAME
    Object::BlankStr - Blank string object

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
     use Object::BlankStr;

     die Object::BlankStr->new; # dies without printing anything

DESCRIPTION
    Object::BlankStr is just an empty object which stringifies to "" (empty
    string). Since it is an object, it has a boolean true value *in some
    cases*. By *in some cases* it means that when object stringification
    occurs before comparison, the truth value becomes false because Perl
    regards empty string as false.

    So far the only case I've found this to be useful is for die()-ing
    without printing anything. If you just use 'die;' or 'die "";' Perl will
    print the default "Died at ..." message. But if you say 'die
    Object::BlankStr->new;' Perl will die without printing anything.
