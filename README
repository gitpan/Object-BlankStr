NAME
    Object::BlankStr - True-valued 'blank' string object

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Object::BlankStr;

     die Object::BlankStr->new; # dies without printing anything

DESCRIPTION
    Provides an object which stringifies to a 'blank' string (actually "
    \b", that is, space followed by a backspace so when printed emulates
    nothing). Since this is an object, it has a true value.

    This is used for example when throwing exception with die(). You don't
    want to print anything ("") but you need it to be a true value because
    otherwise Perl will use "Died at ..." as the default error message.
